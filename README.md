WikiWP
======

A WordPess theme inspired by the Wikipedia look and feel. This theme was started by Chereshka Design and Florian Steller and originally hosted on http://wikiwp.com/. The goal is to contribute these changes back into the base but they, currently, don't have a shared code repository only a link to download the theme.

### Features
* Wikipedia look and feel
* Table of contents automatically generated based on HTML header tags h2, h3, and h4. Note: The title is always h1.
* Tested on WordPress 4.0
* Support for the [WordPress Front-end Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/) when the plugin is enabled for easier editing

I (Bobby Walters) started making changes that'd I like to merge back into the orignial base and possibly convince the authors to create a more official github repository.
